          <h2><a href='/2016/02/18/An-Update-On-What-I-have-Been-Working-On.html'>An update on what I have been working on</a></h2>
          <div class='body'><p>Long time no post! I thought I would give an update on how I’m spending my (rapidly decreasing) holidays.</p>

<h2 id="pomodoro-timer">Pomodoro Timer</h2>

<p>One of the projects for <a href="http://freecodecamp.com">FreeCodeCamp</a> is to make a Pomodoro timer. <em>What is a Pomdoro timer</em>, you ask? It is a timer that switches between 25 minute ‘work’ and 5 minute ‘rest’ periods. It is a way for people to increase productivity as a person working under this method has (supposedly) better focus during the work period, and allows the brain a rest during the break periods.</p>

<p>My pomodoro timer is functionally complete. The timer swaps between work/rest periods and also allows the user to change how long each type of period lasts. However, presentation is lacking. I won’t be happy until it looks as good as it runs!</p>

<p><a href="http://codpen.io/AussieGuy0/pen/jWraeG">Click Here</a> if you want to see what it looks like so far.</p>

<h2 id="local-weather">Local Weather</h2>

<p>Another FreeCodeCamp project. This has a very simple function, display the weather at the user’s location. It uses an JSON call and the API of <a href="http://openweathermap.org">Open Weather Map</a> to retrieve the weather.</p>

<p>So far, I have got the JSON call to work. However, passing values from the retrieved object to variables is not working for me yet. I’m sure if I spend a bit of time on it I’ll get it to work.</p>

<h2 id="points">300 points!</h2>

<p><img src="/media/CodeCampScore.png" alt="Score Image" /></p>

<p>I managed to hit <strong>300 points</strong> on FreeCodeCamp! For those who don’t know, a point is given each time a for each challenge or project completed. I’m proud that I’ve got this far in the course. Hopefully I can see it right to the end!</p>

<p> As you might be aware, I am currently working my way though the course on <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com/"> FreeCodeCamp. </a>
FreeCodeCamp is a online, completely free web development course. It teaches you HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript and more.
The tasks that the course gives you are split into three different types: <strong>Way points</strong> (small tasks made for the user to learn
how to learn programming concepts), <strong>Bonfires</strong> (programming challenges such as reversing a string or translating english
to pig latin) and <strong>Ziplines</strong> (projects that take a considerable amount of time to complete.) </p>

<p> The first zipline that I completed is called 'Personal Portfolio'. With this zipline, I was tasked with creating a one page website
using bootstrap. The website had to fulfill certain requirements, such as having a navigation bar, clickable thumbnails of projects and links
to social media. I believe I did pretty well with the project. I achieved all the requirements required and learnt a lot about bootstrap.
For example, I though that a site built in bootstrap had to be all contained within a container class. Through this project, however, 
I discovered you can have multiple containers to seperate different sections of the page.</p>

          <div class='body'><p>Hello and welcome to the first blog post. This blog will be covering programming
topics such as personal projects, online projects and things learnt from my Computer
Science course. </p>

<p> For technical details about the site, it is running on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">
Github Pages</a>, which allows free web hosting. It includes integration with
<a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> which implements an easy way to blog,
the ability to set common layouts between pages as well as the capabliity to
build/preview website locally and more. Otherwise, the website is based on HTML/CSS.

with the site, don't be afraid to let me know! Improving the responsiveness of the website
is my next priority.  </p>
