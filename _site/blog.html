          <div class='body'><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14071738/12082953/7548910e-b2ea-11e5-8131-c2c51098ff30.png">

<p>Another zipline from <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com/">FreeCodeCamp</a> bites the dust! In this challenge, the task was to create 
an app on <a href="http://codepen.io/">codepen</a> that displayed a random quote. It also had to have a button which displayed another 
quote and a 'tweet' button which allows a user to post the quote to twitter.  </p>

<p>The way I went about completing the zipline was to first create an array that held every quote that could be displayed. When the 
'New Quote' button is clicked, a random number (between 0 and the array length) is generated. The quote is then chosen from the array
position of this random number.  Using the .innerHTML command allowed the new quote to be displayed on the screen. The tweet button was
a lot simpler then I thought it would be. All it does is opens a new window (using window.open) with the URL
"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text="+quoteText+"&related=AnthonyBrunoAUS" (where quoteText is the quote, amazingly). The new window 
then shows a filled out tweet of the quote.  </p>

<p>I found this zipline pretty enjoyable, if a bit easy. I actually found the previous task (Making a portfolio page) harder, probably
because I'm not very good at presentation (yet!). If you want to see the completed product,

<p> As you might be aware, I am currently working my way though the course on <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com/"> FreeCodeCamp. </a>
FreeCodeCamp is a online, completely free web development course. It teaches you HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript and more.
The tasks that the course gives you are split into three different types: <strong>Way points</strong> (small tasks made for the user to learn
how to learn programming concepts), <strong>Bonfires</strong> (programming challenges such as reversing a string or translating english
to pig latin) and <strong>Ziplines</strong> (projects that take a considerable amount of time to complete.) </p>

<p> The first zipline that I completed is called 'Personal Portfolio'. With this zipline, I was tasked with creating a one page website
using bootstrap. The website had to fulfill certain requirements, such as having a navigation bar, clickable thumbnails of projects and links
to social media. I believe I did pretty well with the project. I achieved all the requirements required and learnt a lot about bootstrap.
For example, I though that a site built in bootstrap had to be all contained within a container class. Through this project, however, 
I discovered you can have multiple containers to seperate different sections of the page.</p>

          <div class='body'><p>Hello and welcome to the first blog post. This blog will be covering programming
topics such as personal projects, online projects and things learnt from my Computer
Science course. </p>

<p> For technical details about the site, it is running on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">
Github Pages</a>, which allows free web hosting. It includes integration with
<a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> which implements an easy way to blog,
the ability to set common layouts between pages as well as the capabliity to
build/preview website locally and more. Otherwise, the website is based on HTML/CSS.

with the site, don't be afraid to let me know! Improving the responsiveness of the website
is my next priority.  </p>
