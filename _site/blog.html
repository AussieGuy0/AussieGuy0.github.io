          <h2><a href='/2016/04/14/Vim-8.0-Changelog-Is-Here.html'>Vim 8.0 Changelog Is Here</a></h2>
          <div class='body'><p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Vimlogo.svg/544px-Vimlogo.svg.png" alt="Vim Logo" height="50%" width="50%" /></p>

<p>Vim, the modal text editor and the catalyst of many arguments between developers is nearing it’s next major update, 8.0. Here are my favourite features that this update will include.</p>

<h2 id="asynchronous-support">Asynchronous Support</h2>
<p>One of the big features of Neovim is finally coming to Vim. Asynchronous support introduces multi-thread functionality. This means plugins will be able to run in the background and not freeze the editor when functioning. For example, Syntastic, (Syntax Checking) could continually run in the background and check your code without holding Vim to ransom.</p>

<h2 id="inbuilt-package-support">Inbuilt Package Support</h2>
<p>For a long time, the best way to install a lot of plugins was to use something like Vundle. With Vim 8.0. a group of plugins will be able to be chucked into a folder, and Vim will handle them and (possibly) keep it updated!</p>

<h2 id="ditched-support-for-ms-dos">Ditched Support for MS-DOS</h2>
<p>You read that title right. Vim was still being supported for an OS that came out <strong>34 years ago</strong>. The text editor, however, will be too large of a program for MS-DOS to handle. If you’re one of the people affected by this, maybe this will give you the push to upgrade your OS.</p>

<h2 id="assert-functions-for-plugin-developers">Assert Functions for Plugin Developers</h2>
<p>Plugin developers will be thrown a bone in the new update with the addition of assert functions. This allows the easier creation of tests, which should help reduce bugs in plugins in the long run.</p>

          <h2><a href='/2016/02/18/An-Update-On-What-I-have-Been-Working-On.html'>An update on what I have been working on</a></h2>
          <div class='body'><p>Long time no post! I thought I would give an update on how I’m spending my (rapidly decreasing) holidays.</p>

<h2 id="pomodoro-timer">Pomodoro Timer</h2>

<p>One of the projects for <a href="http://freecodecamp.com">FreeCodeCamp</a> is to make a Pomodoro timer. <em>What is a Pomdoro timer</em>, you ask? It is a timer that switches between 25 minute ‘work’ and 5 minute ‘rest’ periods. It is a way for people to increase productivity as a person working under this method has (supposedly) better focus during the work period, and allows the brain a rest during the break periods.</p>

<p>My pomodoro timer is functionally complete. The timer swaps between work/rest periods and also allows the user to change how long each type of period lasts. However, presentation is lacking. I won’t be happy until it looks as good as it runs!</p>

<p><a href="http://codepen.io/AussieGuy0/pen/jWraeG">Click Here</a> if you want to see what it looks like so far.</p>

<h2 id="local-weather">Local Weather</h2>

<p>Another FreeCodeCamp project. This has a very simple function, display the weather at the user’s location. It uses an JSON call and the API of <a href="http://openweathermap.org">Open Weather Map</a> to retrieve the weather.</p>

<p>So far, I have got the JSON call to work. However, passing values from the retrieved object to variables is not working for me yet. I’m sure if I spend a bit of time on it I’ll get it to work.</p>

<h2 id="points">300 points!</h2>

<p><img src="/media/CodeCampScore.png" alt="Score Image" /></p>

<p>I managed to hit <strong>300 points</strong> on FreeCodeCamp! For those who don’t know, a point is given each time a for each challenge or project completed. I’m proud that I’ve got this far in the course. Hopefully I can see it right to the end!</p>

          <div class='body'><a href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14071738/12082953/7548910e-b2ea-11e5-8131-c2c51098ff30.png">

<p>Another zipline from <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com/">FreeCodeCamp</a> bites the dust! In this challenge, the task was to create 
an app on <a href="http://codepen.io/">codepen</a> that displayed a random quote. It also had to have a button which displayed another 
quote and a 'tweet' button which allows a user to post the quote to twitter.  </p>

<p>The way I went about completing the zipline was to first create an array that held every quote that could be displayed. When the 
'New Quote' button is clicked, a random number (between 0 and the array length) is generated. The quote is then chosen from the array
position of this random number.  Using the .innerHTML command allowed the new quote to be displayed on the screen. The tweet button was
a lot simpler then I thought it would be. All it does is opens a new window (using window.open) with the URL
"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text="+quoteText+"&related=AnthonyBrunoAUS" (where quoteText is the quote, amazingly). The new window 
then shows a filled out tweet of the quote.  </p>

<p>I found this zipline pretty enjoyable, if a bit easy. I actually found the previous task (Making a portfolio page) harder, probably
because I'm not very good at presentation (yet!). If you want to see the completed product,

<p> As you might be aware, I am currently working my way though the course on <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com/"> FreeCodeCamp. </a>
FreeCodeCamp is a online, completely free web development course. It teaches you HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript and more.
The tasks that the course gives you are split into three different types: <strong>Way points</strong> (small tasks made for the user to learn
how to learn programming concepts), <strong>Bonfires</strong> (programming challenges such as reversing a string or translating english
to pig latin) and <strong>Ziplines</strong> (projects that take a considerable amount of time to complete.) </p>

<p> The first zipline that I completed is called 'Personal Portfolio'. With this zipline, I was tasked with creating a one page website
using bootstrap. The website had to fulfill certain requirements, such as having a navigation bar, clickable thumbnails of projects and links
to social media. I believe I did pretty well with the project. I achieved all the requirements required and learnt a lot about bootstrap.
For example, I though that a site built in bootstrap had to be all contained within a container class. Through this project, however, 
I discovered you can have multiple containers to seperate different sections of the page.</p>
