title: What Tools I Use

Long time no see! A mixture of uni and life commitments as meant I've not had a
whole lot of free time to keep this blog up to date. Nevertheless, I have come
up with the personal goal of updating this blog at least once a month. 

In this post, I wanted to share what tools I use regularly. I believe that every
developer should have a small 'go-to' selection of tools on their tool belt.
Knowing all the commands, shortcuts and features of a few programs is better
than knowing a little in a lot of programs. This is because a developer working
with a tool that they know all the functionality of will be much more efficient
than a developer using a tool they *kind-of* know. Here's my small selection of tools
that I use regularly. 

## IDE
While not every programming language benefits from a IDE, as a Java developer, I
find that an IDE increases my productivity massively. The IDE that I use is
JetBrain's [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). It's got a hefty price-tag (although students/teachers can
grab it free), but the features it contains are unrivaled. **Great code
completion, an amazing inline debugger and a sleek dark theme** are only some of
the features that I love. 

Previously, I have used [Netbeans](https://netbeans.org/). I would find it hard to go back to,
but has similar (if lacking) features compared to IntelliJ. It's also **completely free**,
which is a big plus.

## Text Editor
Based on my last post, it's not a surprise that I use Vim as my primary text
editor. Vim, for those not in the know, is a modal, keyboard-controlled text editor. What these means
is that it has different 'modes' that serve different purposes. You start in
'normal' mode, which is the mode you spend the most time in. It allows **powerful**
text manipulation commands. For instance, typing 'dd' will delete the current
line, 'daw' will delete the current word and 'dt)' will delete until the first
closed bracket. Other commands allow you to copy, paste, replace and change to
your heart's content! Insert mode is another commonly used
mode which controls pretty much the same as a normal text editor (like notepad). 

Although Vim has an extremely high learning curve, the **pay off is great**. As it
is completely keyboard controlled, it means that you'll be able to reach for your
mouse much less often, increasing the amount of work you'll be able to do. 

## Note Taking
Note taking is something I'm trying to utilise more of. I had a look at
[Evernote](https://evernote.com/), but they recently changed their pricing plan to favour paid users.
I'm currently sticking with [Google Keep](http://www.google.com.au/keep/), which is a web
based service connected to your Google account. Text formatting is quite
limited, and I feel like the presentation is quite messy as it shows all your
notes on the home screen. I would much prefer having a small selection of 'home'
notes that link to other sections of notes. Despite these shortcomings, I do
find it useful to jot down ideas and things I need to remember.

## Productivity
To know what I have to do and to keep me on track, I use [KanbanFlow](https://kanbanflow.com). KanbanFlow
is a web app that allows you to track process in tasks by putting them in
categories ranging from 'new' to 'done'. I find this great for university as I
can easily see what work I  need to prioritise. KanbanFlow also has a
Pomodoro timer feature, which I use a lot.
