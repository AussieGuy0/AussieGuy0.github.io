Recently (yes, I say recently even though it happened last year!) I attended the very first edition of DDDAdelaide. It's awesome finally
seeing Adelaide getting a software development conference. It was really well
put together, and I had a great time. I would highly recommend anyone going
to the next one!

This article covers my key takeaways from some of the talks I saw. I've also
included each presenter's Twitter and a link to the slides where possible.

## Shifting Left: DevSecOps as an Approach to Building Secure Products 
[Jakob Pennington](https://twitter.com/JakobTheDev)

Fantastic talk about moving security testing from near/after the release stage,
to the development stage. As a programmer by trade, I know security is
important but it sometimes feels like it is left  behind a bit in the engineering process. The suggestion to
add security testing as part of automated CI/CD is definitely something I want to
explore doing.

- Recommendation to have a separate environment for security testing
- Security tools: Burp Suite (expensive!), Owasp Zap (free!)
- Tools to help manage dependencies: Snyk, Dependabot
- 'Sans Appsec' as a resource for application security
- Guidelines: Security shouldn't get in devs way and track security defects tracked as tickets

## GraphQL, gRPC or REST? Resolving the API Developer's Dilemma
[Rob Crowley](https://twitter.com/robcrowley) - [Slides](https://speakerdeck.com/robcrowley/graphql-grpc-or-rest-resolving-the-api-developers-dilemma)

Rob initially goes into the history of API technology, with some funny commentary on how
we think the newest thing that comes out is the 'best' (*'SOAP is dead, long live
REST'* to *'REST is dead long live GraphQL'*)

- REST is generally a good choice for starting an API
- GraphQL is not the best choice for server to server communication
- There exists some challenges regarding caching with GraphQL
- The speed of a GraphQL response is limited by the slowest field
- *GraphQL eliminates the need for versioning* - we didn't need versioning in
other API types either!
    - We should strive for 'Graceful Evolution'. (e.g. Don't add required
    inputs/don't remove outputs/don't change type of field/follow Robustness
    Principle)
- Deprecations are still hard, even with GraphQL
- Integration Pattern - Martin Fowler
- Recommendations:
    - REST: Most of your API is CRUD
    - GraphQL: Excels with multiple clients with Heterogeneous data requirements
    - GRPC: Good for synchronous comms between microservices
- Need to look into GRPC more!

**Main takeaway:** There is no universal best API style, but there is always a best
API style for you problem.

## Modern Authentication 101
[Dasith Wijesiriwardena](https://dasith.me/) - [Slides](https://www.slideshare.net/DasithWijesiriwarden/ddd-melbourne-2019-modern-authentication-101-161977250)

A nice overview of how to handle authentication. Dasith provided an in-depth
description on the problems with the classic model of authentication, and
described modern alternatives.

- Really nice flow chart on what OAuth flow you should use, depending on the
  device, what type of app it is, etc.
- Can see myself going back to the slides for reference!

## TypeScript: Beyond 101
[Jaime Febres](https://twitter.com/jaimefebres) - [Source Code](https://github.com/emiaj/AdvancedTypescript-Adelaide)

As a Java guy, TypeScript is something that really resonates with me. I'm
always eager to hear more about it!

Jaime showed some cool things that are achievable in TypeScript. The `keyof`
feature was something that found immediate use for me for a project I have at
home.

The speaker also had a good sense of humor, with a couple of digs at
JavaScript's 'type' system.

## Making React Apps Accessible: It's easier than you think
[Jess Bud](https://twitter.com/jessbudd4) - [Slides](https://noti.st/jessbudd/UUp8f2)

Like security, I feel like accessibility is one of those things that are an after
thought in web dev. Jess brings some stats to show that things
shouldn't be that way! 

What I like about this talk, is while there was a focus on React, the techniques
shown can be applied to any front end framework. Also, I'll always love a web
dev talk that promotes the use of semantic HTML!
