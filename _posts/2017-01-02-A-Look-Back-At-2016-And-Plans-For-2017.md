title: A Look Back at 2016 and Plans For 2017
---

## 2016 Retrospective
2016 was a huge year for me. I finished my Bachelor of Computer Science (although
my graduation ceremony isn't until April), got a job, wrote a few blog posts, and 
made my [first contribution to open source](https://github.com/EasyBatch/easybatch-framework/pull/258). 

## Goals for 2017
As 2017 will be my first year in a long time that I won't have study as my main
focus, I thought that I would write some goals that I want to achieve for the
year. 

### Code everyday
Practice makes perfect. I would like to keep programming each day to keep
developing my technical skills. To help kickstart this habit, I will be
partaking in
[#100DaysOfCode](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/start-2017-with-the-100daysofcode-improved-and-updated-18ce604b237b), a challenge for programmers to write every day and tweet about the progress made.


**How**: Spend at least 1 hour a day programming (outside of work). 

### Work on Web Development Skills
The web continues to be more and more integrated into almost everyone's life. While 
I have had some experience in web development, I believe that I should know a lot more. To 
do this I will be spending some of my programming time on learning 
JavaScript, node.js, HTML and CSS.

**How**: Keep working on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com), start and finish courses:
[JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/), [Practical
Javascript](https://watchandcode.com/p/practical-javascript) and the node.js
path on [pluralsight](https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/skills/node-js)

### Blog more

I've stated this before in a previous blog post, but I want to blog more. I
believe that this will allow me to increase my knowledge in topics that I write
in. It will also provide an easy way to share my knowledge with fellow
programmers. 

**How**: Release a blog post every 15 days, by writing 100 words a day. 

### Keep a Journal

> "Journals are the Google of the mind" - [Zach Holman](https://zachholman.com/posts/keeping-a-journal/)

I've come to realise that the brain is not the best for perfectly storing memories, or
keeping ideas for long periods of time. I would like to keep a journal that
could store all these ideas, feelings and thoughts. I think it'll also be cool
to look back on journal entries and reflect on what's happened in my life.

**How**: Write something (at least a paragraph) in my journal everyday.
