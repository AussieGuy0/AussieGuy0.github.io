<p> As you might be aware, I am currently working my way though the course on <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com/"> FreeCodeCamp. </a>
FreeCodeCamp is a online, compltetly free web development course. It teaches you HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript and more.
The tasks that the course gives you are split into three diffrent types: <strong>Waypoints</strong> (small tasks made for the user to learn
how to learn programming concepts), <strong>Bonfires</strong> (programming challenges such as reversing a string or translating english
to pig latin) and <strong>Ziplines</strong> (projects that take a considrible amount of time to complete.) </p>

<p> The first zipline that I completeted is called 'Personal Portfolio'. With this zipline, I was tasked with creating a one page website
using bootstrap. The website must fufill certain requirements, such as having a navigation bar, clickable thumbnails of projects and links
to social media. </p>
