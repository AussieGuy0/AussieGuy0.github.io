Another year down! In this post I look back on what I did last year, what I need
to improve on and plans for the future.

## The Good
- Made 302 commits on GitHub (Up from 145 in 2016!)
- Deployed a Java library to Maven. [SDGen](https://github.com/AussieGuy0/SDgen)
- My post: 'The non-broken promise of static typing' gained some traction on
  [dev.to](https://dev.to/aussieguy0/the-non-broken-promise-of-static-typing)
- Built a simple (but useful!) Node.js application for checking if a domain has
  been registered. [Domain Check](https://github.com/AussieGuy0/domaincheck)
- Created a pretty cool (in my opinion!) Chrome extension.
  [gmail-pwned](https://github.com/AussieGuy0/gmail-pwned)
- Played around with Kotlin. I need to use it more but my initial thoughts is
  that it solves a lot of problems I have with Java.

## To Improve
- More blogging! I only posted 5 times in 2017 which is no improvement from 2016. I'd like to have at least 12 posts in 2018.
- I felt like I got pretty lazy with a few things at various points of the year.
  I need to be more aware on what makes me motivated.

## Plans
- Build a webapp using [vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
- Get gmail-pwned on the chrome store
- More blogging! (mentioned before)
- Contribute to other open source projects (or create one that people use!)
