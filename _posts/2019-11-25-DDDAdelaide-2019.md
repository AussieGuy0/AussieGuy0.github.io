## Rise Of The Machines - Technology in Humanity
[Lars Klint](https://twitter.com/larsklint)

Keynote of the day. A a general talk about bionic enhancements, where
we're currently at, and questions for the future. Maybe a bit hard to take anything
I can use form this talk, but it was interesting nonetheless. Lars is a
great speaker!

## Shifting Left: DevSecOps as an Approach to Building Secure Products 
[Jakob Pennington](https://twitter.com/JakobTheDev)

Fantastic talk about moving security testing from near/after the release stage,
to the development stage. 

- Recommendation to have a separate env for security testing
- Security tools: Burp Suite (expensive!), owasp zap (free!)
- Tools to help manage dependencies: Snyk, Dependabot
- Sans Appsec as a resource for application security
- Guidelines: Don't get in devs way, security defects tracked as tickets

## GraphQL, gRPC or REST? Resolving the API Developer's Dilemma
[Rob Crowley](https://twitter.com/robcrowley) - [Slides](https://speakerdeck.com/robcrowley/graphql-grpc-or-rest-resolving-the-api-developers-dilemma)

First goes into the history of API technology, with some funny commentary on how
we think the newest thing that comes out is the 'best' (SOAP is dead, long live
REST, REST is dead long live GraphQL)

- REST is generally a good choice for starting an API
- GraphQL is not best choice for server to server comms
- Some challenges regarding caching with GraphQL
- The speed of a GraphQL response is limited by the slowest field
- GraphQL eliminates the need for versioning - we didn't need versioning in
other API types either!
    - We should strive for 'Graceful Evolution'. (e.g. Don't add required
    inputs/don't remove outputs/don't change type of field/follow Robustness
    Prinicple (Be conservative in what you send, be liberal in what you accept)
- Deprecations are still hard, even with GraphQL
- Integration Patter - Martin Fowler
- REST: CRUD based stuff
- GraphQL: Excels with multiple clients with Heterogenous data requirements
- GRPC: Good for synchronous comms between microservices

- Need to look into GRPC more!

Main takeaway: There is no universal best API style, but there is always a best
API style for you problem.

- Really nice flow chart on what OAuth flow you should use

## It's 2019, time to talk about web components (again)
[William Tulloch](https://twitter.com/wtulloch)

- A nice look into where web components are at
- Nice explanations on what Shadow DOM is
- Lots of live coding
- Unfortunately, ran out of time. Would've liked to seen the whole thing.
