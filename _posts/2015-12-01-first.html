<p>Hello and welcome to the first blog post. This blog will be covering programming
topics such as personal projects, online projects and things learnt from my Computer
Science course. </p>

<p> For technical details about the site, it is running on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">
Github Pages</a>, which allows free web hosting. It includes integration with
<a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> which implements an easy way to blog,
the ability to set common layouts between pages as well as the capabliity to
build/preview website locally and more. Otherwise, the website is based on HTML/CSS.
For the full source code, <a href="https://github.com/AussieGuy0/AussieGuy0.github.io">click here.</a> If there's any bugs/problems
with the site, don't be afraid to let me know! Improving the responsiveness of the website
is my next priority.  </p>
