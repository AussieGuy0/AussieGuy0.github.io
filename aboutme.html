<h1 class="page-title"> About Me </h1>

<p>I'm <strong>Anthony Bruno</strong>, an Australian software engineer and a passionate Adelaide United fan.</p>

<p>I graduated from <a href="https://www.flinders.edu.au/">Flinders University</a> with a Bachelor of Computer Science. My first job was developing Java frameworks and libraries with <a href="https://www.univocity.com/">Univocity</a> while I was still studying.</p>
    
<p> I then worked at <a href="https://www.sintelix.com/about">Sintelix</a> where I helped in the development of an awesome text analytics platform.</p>

<p> I currently work at <a href="https://lifelenz.com">LIFELENZ</a>. <p>

<p> I generally ply my trade on the backend with <strong>Java</strong> and <strong>Kotlin</strong>. I have also used <strong>Python</strong> (Django) and <strong>Javascript</strong> (jQuery, AngularJS, Vue) professionally. </p>

<p> I use vim to edit text, run IntelliJ as my IDE and live in Linux. I prefer spaces over tabs.</p>

<p>You can find me on <a href="https://github.com/AussieGuy0">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthonybruno1996/"> LinkedIn</a> and
